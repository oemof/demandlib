VDI4655 Load Profiles
=====================

Overview
--------

The VDI 4655 module implements load profile generation for residential buildings
according to the German engineering standard VDI 4655. Heat and power demand
profiles are generated based on typical days and building characteristics.

Key Features:

* Generates heating, hot water and power demand profiles for residential buildings
* Supports both single-family (EFH) and multi-family houses (MFH)
* Considers weather data, based on the building location in Germany
* Accounts for seasonal variations and holidays
* Customizable temperature limits for season definitions
* Adjustable temporal resolution (e.g., hourly, 15-minute intervals)


Example Usage
-------------

Here's a basic example of how to use the VDI 4655 module::

    from demandlib import vdi

    # Define houses
    houses = [
        {
            "name": "EFH_1",
            "house_type": "EFH",
            "N_Pers": 3,
            "N_WE": 1,
            "Q_Heiz_a": 6000,
            "Q_TWW_a": 1500,
            "W_a": 5250,
        }
    ]

    # Create climate object with weather data
    climate = vdi.Climate().from_try_data(try_region=4)

    # Create region
    region = vdi.Region(
        2017,
        climate=climate,
        houses=houses,
        resample_rule="1h"
    )

    # Generate load curves
    load_curves = region.get_load_curve_houses()

House Parameters
----------------

The houses need to be defined as a list of dictionaries.
Required parameters for each house:

* ``name``: Unique identifier for the house
* ``house_type``: Either "EFH" (single-family) or "MFH" (multi-family)
* ``N_Pers``: Number of persons, up to 12 (relevant for EFH)
* ``N_WE``: Number of apartments, up to 40 (relevant for MFH)

Optional parameters for each house:

* ``Q_Heiz_a``: Annual heating demand in kWh
* ``Q_TWW_a``: Annual hot water demand in kWh
* ``W_a``: Annual electricity demand in kWh
* ``summer_temperature_limit``: Temperature threshold for summer season (default: 15°C)
* ``winter_temperature_limit``: Temperature threshold for winter season (default: 5°C)

(If any of the annual energy values are not provided, the respective time series
will be returned with all NaNs.)

Weather Data
------------

The module uses German test reference year (TRY) weather data by 'Deutscher Wetterdienst' (DWD)
for determining the daily temperature and cloud coverage. Weather data is handled through the Climate class,
which offers several ways to initialize:

* Use built-in TRY weather data from 2010::

    climate = vdi.Climate().from_try_data(try_region=4)

* Load data from a custom weather file::

    climate = vdi.Climate().from_file(fn_weather='path/to/weather.dat', try_region=4)

* Initialize with your own data::

    climate = vdi.Climate(
        temperature=your_temp_data,
        cloud_coverage=your_cloud_data,
        energy_factors=your_energy_factors
    )

The weather file must adhere to the standard of the TRY weather data published
in 2016 by DWD (available at https://kunden.dwd.de/obt/)
