Further Profiles
================

We implemented further profiles (one until now) to represent further demand sectors which are not covered by the BDEW load profiles.

Industrial Electrical Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
+++++++++++

The industrial electrical profile uses a step function synthesized using different
scaling factors for weekdays, weekend days and holidays as well as day time and night
time.

Usage
+++++
The industrial profile is explained in the example `electricity_demand_example.py`
located in the examples directory of the repository.

    holidays = {
        datetime.date(2018, 1, 1): "New year",
    }

        dt_index=pd.date_range("01-01-2018", "01-01-2019", freq="15min"),
        holidays=holidays
    )
    # Get step load profile with own scaling factors and definition of
    # beginning of workday
    ind_elec_demand = ilp.simple_profile(
